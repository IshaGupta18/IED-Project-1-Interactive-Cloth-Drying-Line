This is an interactive cloth-drying line in which the rope has been looped around 2 pulleys and 2 touch sensors have been provided to move the rope in the left or right direction so that a person can hang or remove clothes by standing at one place only, without having to walk the entire rope length for this purpose. Ultrasonic sensors have also been used for the ropes movement, if the person wants to use hand gestures to control the line. A DHT-11 sensor has also been used to send temperature and humidity readings to the user's phone through an app which is linked to the interactive rope via bluetooth, so that the user is aware of the weather conditions around the rope and can remove them if its getting to humid or hang them if its getting too hot.
